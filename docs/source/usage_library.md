# Usage of the library

## Installation

The libary is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/papass/). You can install it
via `pip` like so:

```{code-block} shell
$ pip install papass
```

## Usage

The library can be used as a library for other projects but mainly I intend it to be used
in an *interactive* python or [ipython](https://ipython.org/) session. See the [API
documentation](./api.rst) for details and examples.
